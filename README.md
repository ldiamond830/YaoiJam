# Fated Formula: ULTRA NITRO CRUISERS 
## A Racing game coded in Unity
This game is currently in development for submission to the [Yaoi Game Jam 20204](https://itch.io/jam/yaoi-game-jam-2024). Racing is the ultimate test of endurance, modification, and bond between Driver and Racer. In the future, cyborg technology allows people to turn themselves into race cars, with their hands and feet grafted with axles and wheels. Meet Acura, who wants to become the best racer in the world, and has the body to make that happen. He's teamed up with his childhood friend Maxx, who has a large debt to pay, and desperately needs to win. Drive these two to victory as they find out their feelings for each other.
